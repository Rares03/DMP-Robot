## ðŸ›  Getting Started

### Requirements

1. *ESP32 Microcontroller*
   - *Description*: The ESP32 serves as the brain of your car, handling Bluetooth communication with the Android app and processing control signals for the motors.  
   - *Link*: [ESP32](https://www.sigmanortec.ro/placa-dezvoltare-esp32-cu-wifi-si-bluetooth)  

2. *Arduino Nano*
   - **Description**: This microcontroller can assist the ESP32 by offloading tasks, such as motor control or sensor data processing.  
   - **Link**: [Arduino Nano](https://store.arduino.cc/en-ro/products/arduino-nano)  

3. *L298N Motor Driver*  
   - **Description**: A dual H-bridge motor driver that allows you to control the speed and direction of up to four DC motors.  
   - **Link**: [L298N](https://components101.com/modules/l293n-motor-driver-module)  

4. *DC Motors with Wheels* (x4)  
   - *Description*: Standard DC motors paired with wheels for propelling your car forward, backward, and turning.  
   - *Link*: [DC Motors](https://www.wiltronics.com.au/product/10137/yellow-motor-3-12vdc-2-flats-shaft/)  

5. *4x AAA Batteries*  
   - *Description*: The primary power source for the motors or the entire system. A battery holder ensures secure connections.  

- *Software*:
  - Arduino IDE (for ESP firmware)
  - Android Studio (for customizing the app)
